      "fullText":"When Luce stopped for a visit, Maddie would give her a drink of cold spring water from a dented ladle and sing her a song. Maddie knew many ancient ballads about girls getting in trouble and being murdered by the men who had lately so much wanted to get up on them. She warbled and keened at an extreme pitch of emotion unattainable by the young, and the verses of the songs went on and on toward a receding conclusion. They were dark- night songs. Knockedup girls got stabbed or shot or hit in the head, and then buried in the cold ground or thrown into the black deep river. Pretty Polly. Little Omie Wise. Go down, go down, you Knoxville Girl. Sometimes reproduction did not even factor into the narrative. The man snuffed the girl out because he could not own her, a killing offense if the girl’s opinions ran counter to his urges. In the ballads, love and murder and possession fi t tight against one another as an outgrown wedding band on a swollen fi nger.<br/><br/>Back then, Luce had thought Maddie’s songs were only interesting antiques, but her sister had proved their abiding truth when she came up against Johnny Johnson. Their feelings ran so hot at the start that it must have been sad to watch, though awfully compelling to read about in Lily’s occasional letters, where new love’s bells jangled like a fire engine’s. Lily’s spirit neediness expressed itself raw as a kerosene blaze in the material world. Love, love, love. That’s how she described those few months of desire. Each letter signed in a looping hand: Love, Lily"

      "fullText":"There's a revolver inside the trailer, a huge British Webley .45, loaded, but it's out of reach. Even if I had it in my hands I'd hesitate to blast a fellow creature at such close range, shooting between my own legs at a living target flat on solid rock thirty inches away. It would be like murder; and where would I set my coffee? I have personal convictions to uphold… Ideals, you might say. I prefer not to kill animals. I'm a humanist; I'd rather kill a man than a snake.<br/><br/>American essayist, novelist, and selfdescribed agrarian anarchist. Born in Pennsylvania, Abbey lived in the Southwest from 1948, when he began his studies at the University of New Mexico, until his death. He took as his most pervasive theme the beauty of the Southwestern desert and the ways it has been despoiled by government, business, and tourism. Abbey's novels include Fire on the Mountain (1963), Good News (1980), and The Monkey Wrench Gang (1975), which is credited with helping to inspire the radical environmentalist movement. He published several collections of essays, among them Abbey's Road (1979), Beyond the Wall: Essays from the Outside (1984), One Life at a Time, Please (1988), and, most famously, Desert Solitaire (1968), drawing on his years as a ranger in the national parks of southern Utah.

      "fullText":"THINK OF THE ADVANTAGES THAT DIGITAL MEDIA have brought to so many lives over the past few decades. Thirty years ago, if you wanted to contact someone far away, you most likely wrote a letter. Phoning could be expensive, and email was largely unavailable. Now you might email, text, Skype, tweet, or blog. Twenty years ago, if you wanted a piece of information that was not available in your home, you might have traveled to a library. Now you would probably go straight to the Internet.<br/><br/>Show noteAround the world, billions of people now spend much of their time interacting through digital media (FIGURE 1.1). In fact, many people, especially young people, feel panicky to be away from their 24/7 connection to the electronic universe. When was the last time you willingly went a week without your phone or computer? A day? Some of you probably cannot last more than a few hours, or you become anxious when your instructor insists that cell phones be turned off in the classroom.<br/><br/>You might think, therefore, that our more frequent communications with others would bring many benefits to our social lives. Early proponents of social media, such as the creators of Facebook, envisioned a flatter world—that is, a world with fewer obstacles between people. In their view, technology would make us more connected and give us stronger social ties. We would stay in touch with old friends while easily making new ones. Our new friends would be people who shared our interests, whether they lived on the next street 4or on some tiny island thousands of miles away."

      "fullText":"As with any new endeavor, it takes practice to become an experienced listener. We often “listen” to music as a background to another activity—perhaps studying or just relaxing. In either case, we are probably not concentrating on the music. This type of “partial listening” is normal and appealing, but this book aims to develop listening skills that expand your musical memory.You probably have favorite books, movies, or songs that you like to revisit again and again, and each time you may notice something new, or appreciate even more a moment you have grown to cherish. It’s precisely through repeated encounters that we gain both familiarity with and understanding of the touchstones of our culture. And one of the wonders of the present-day world is that we have the opportunity to listen to recorded music almost any time we want. We encourage you to listen repeatedly to the examples this book provides: with this kind of repeated, attentive listening, you will gain skills you can then transfer to new repertories as well as to your favorite songs.<br/><br/>At the same time, while recordings facilitate repeated listening, it’s important to hear music in performance, for nothing can equal the excitement of a live concert. The crowded hall, the visual and aural stimulation of a performance, and even the element of unpredictability—of what might happen on a particular night—all contribute to the unique communicative powers of people making music.<br/><br/>There are certain traditions surrounding concerts and concertgoing: these include the way performers dress, the appropriate moments to applaud, and even the choice of seats. These aspects of performance differ between art-music and popular-music concerts. Understanding the differing traditions, and knowing what to expect, will contribute to your enjoyment of the event."

      "fullText":"Psychology in Your Life was created to meet the needs of a wide variety of students and the teachers who work with them on a daily basis. The book is based on the experiences of students in introductory psychology classes who yearn to be successful in learning the material but who don’t always know how to do so. And it is guided by psychological research that reveals which teaching practices best engage students, get them to actively work with the material, and enhance their learning. In short, Psychology in Your Life is designed to support success both in ixinstructors’ teaching psychology and in students’ learning how to apply psychological concepts to daily life.<br/><br/>How does Psychology in Your Life support the needs of teachers and students at the same time? Quite simply, by acknowledging the fact that great teaching and great learning go together. After all, great teaching can help students learn, but students play an important active role in their own learning. Students can learn in the absence of great teaching. But when teachers get the support they need, they can have an incredibly important impact in facilitating the learning processes. We created Psychology in Your Life to reflect the three interconnected activities that must occur in excellent educational environments: teaching, learning, and investigating improvements. These three activities are reflected in the interconnected framework of all aspects of Psychology in Your Life, which is: I Teach, I Learn, I Improve."
